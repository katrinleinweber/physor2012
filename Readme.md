## How ?

Before you come to the boot camp, you will need to bring a laptop with which to 
follow along interactively with the tutorials. In order to do this, you will 
need to install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), download 
[this virtual machine 
image](http://s3.amazonaws.com/scopatz/PhysorSCBC2012.ova), 
and open the image using VirtualBox.

By doing so, you will have, on your laptop, a virtual environment pre-loaded 
with all of the necessary software (a terminal, text editors, git, python, etc) 
for the tutorial. 

## Where?

Meeting Room 301 A, The Knoxville Convention Center, Knoxville, TN.

## When ?

The workshop will last from 9am to 12pm on Sunday May 15th, 2012. 

## Who?

The workshop will be led by Paul Wilson, Joshua Peterson, Paul Romano, & Anthony Scopatz.
It was organized by The Hacker Within, a peer-led computational science teaching organization.
